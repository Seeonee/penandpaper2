Add a mechanism to add bonuses. These probably don't need to be displayed, since they're encapsulated in the text anyways.
Add a distinction between player and monster codices.
Refactor all the "Character" stuff into helpers that accept a database of characters (PCs or NPCs) and an entity from that database.
Use LESS to define color constants (and maybe more).
Make it possible to clear levelboxes as long as the equipped skill is a lower level.
Add a way to create new characters from the home view.
Add a way to delete characters from the home view.
Add a way to admin-delete characters from the characters page.
Clean up all the client/server/lib common code lying around. Take server-side code that would also be useful to the client and move it into lib.
Add tooltips to skilltree tiles.
Consider getting rid of the grey highlight when hovering on equipped skilltree tiles.
