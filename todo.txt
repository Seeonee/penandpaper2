Add a distinction between player and monster codices.
Refactor all the "Character" stuff into helpers that accept a database of characters (PCs or NPCs) and an entity from that database.
Add styling for the character attributes.
Split up the character page into a summary and an edit view.
Add a color pallette and redo the styling on the tiles to incorporate it.
Use LESS to define color constants (and maybe more).
Make it possible to clear levelboxes as long as the equipped skill is a lower level.
